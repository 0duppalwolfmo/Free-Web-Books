Gerard Lico is a professor of architecture and cultural heritage studies at the University of the Philippines Diliman. He is also a practicing architect and a heritage conservation advocate. He has written several books and articles on Philippine architecture, urbanism, and culture, such as *Edifice Complex: Power, Myth, and Marcos State Architecture* and *Philippine Art Deco: 1910-1950*.
 
In *Arkitekturang Filipino*, Lico traces the evolution of Philippine architecture from its indigenous roots to its colonial transformations to its modern expressions. He covers topics such as vernacular architecture, religious architecture, civic architecture, domestic architecture, urbanization, foreign influences, and contemporary trends.

The book is divided into six parts: Part I: The Indigenous Tradition; Part II: The Colonial Encounter; Part III: The American Interlude; Part IV: The Postwar Reconstruction; Part V: The Marcos Era; and Part VI: The Contemporary Scene. Each part consists of several chapters that explore the main themes and features of each era. The book also includes a glossary of terms, a bibliography, an index, and a list of acknowledgments.
